Brief Introduction 10/06/2025
In this project, I'm going to build a basic recipe website. 
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. 
The website won't look very pretty by the time I'm finished. Nevertheless, it's main goal is to build my HTML skills such as:
HTML boilerplate 
Working with text - strong and emphasis etc.
Lists Links and Images
